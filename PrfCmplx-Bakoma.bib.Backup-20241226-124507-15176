Although formulas naturally   arising in interactive proofs do not require a state-of-the-art SAT   solver, the conversion to clausal form required by DPLL strongly   damages the performance of the procedure. In this paper, we present   a reflexive DPLL algorithm formalized in Coq which outperforms the   existing tactics.  It is tightly coupled with a lazy CNF conversion   scheme which, unlike Tseitin-style approaches, does not disrupt the   procedure. This conversion relies on a lazy mechanism which requires   slight adaptations of the original DPLL. As far as we know, this is   the first formal proof of this mechanism and its Coq implementation   raises interesting challenges.}

We prove soundness and completeness for this system, and instantiate our solver directly on the propositional fragment of Coq's logic in order to obtain a fully reflexive  tactic. Such a tactic represents a first and important step towards our ultimate goal of embedding an automated theorem prover inside the Coq system. We also extract a certified OCaml implementation of the algorithm}
