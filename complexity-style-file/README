complexity - a LaTeX package that defines commands to typeset
Computational Complexity Classes such as $\P$ and $\NP$ (as well
as hundreds of others).  It also offers several options including
which font classes are typeset in and how many are defined (all
of them or just the basic, most commonly used ones).

Written by Chris Bourke <cbourke@cse.unl.edu>

No dependencies other than the standard ifthen package.
